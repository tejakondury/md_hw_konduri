For an FCC structure:
Lattice constant (Angstoms) = 4.04976352616037;
Cohesive energy (eV) = -3.31831722204653;

For a BCC structure:
Lattice constant (Angstoms) = 3.21911196328926;
Cohesive energy (eV) = -3.30161839041887;

For a SC structure:
Lattice constant (Angstoms) = 2.68705318650982;
Cohesive energy (eV) = -3.06265447774071;

So as we can observe the FCC structure has the lowest possible energy. Hence Al is more stable as FCC structure.
